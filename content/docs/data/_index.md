<!-- Page Content -->
This section contains information about how data is collected by MPLib.js and saved in Firebase.
There are three main aspects to data collection (
  [sessions](#sessions),
  [states](#states), and
  [recorded data](#recorded-data)
). These three data collection components are described below. You can find more specific
information about the respective components in their own sub-pages.

## Example

Data recorded on Firebase will look as follows:

```yaml
  # Name you give your experiment
ðŸžƒ experimentName: {
      # Session specific data
    ðŸžƒ sessions: {
        ðŸž‚ -O4bhX9wmx0cFlNK6ZZQ: {}
      },
      # State specific data
    ðŸžƒ states: {
        ðŸž‚ -O4bhX9wmx0cFlNK6ZZQ: {}
      },
      # Recorded data
    ðŸžƒ recordedData: {
        ðŸž‚ -O4Tzf-PJ5F8r1iVUmBk: {}
      }
}
```

## Sessions

A session is ...

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card
    url="sessions/"
    title="Sessions"
    icon="bookmark"
    subtitle="Metadata relevant to an experiment"
    >}}
{{< /cards >}}


## States

A state is ...

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card
    url="states/"
    title="States"
    icon="cube"
    subtitle="Experiment specific data"
    >}}
{{< /cards >}}


## Recorded Data

Recorded data is the permanetly saved version of a state. It has the same structure as state data,
however, it is saved under its own key value `recordedData`. Additionally, every update that is
made to state data will be saved under a unique key in `recordedData`.

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card
    url="recorded-data/"
    title="Recorded Data"
    icon="server"
    subtitle="Saved data for analysis"
    >}}
{{< /cards >}}
