Write some stuff here about the data collected in `recordData`...

## Example

Recorded data takes a similar structure to the data recorded by `states`. However, there is
additional metadata that is collected. It will look as follows:

```yaml
ðŸžƒ recordedData: {
      # TODO
    ðŸžƒ -O4Tzf-PJ5F8r1iVUmBk: {
        ðŸž‚ allPlayersEver: {},
        ðŸž‚ players: {},
    }
}
```
